[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/github/license/CailinBellWold/Team-Profile-Generator?style=plastic)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

## Description 

Refactored starter-code to create an application called Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes using an Express.js back-end. Notes are saved and retrieved from a JSON file. Front-end code was included in starter code.  

### Motivation
This project our first foray into truly full-stack web design as part of our Full Stack Bootcamp through the University of Washington. 

### Learning Targets
This exercise provided my first experience with building an Express.js server, writing all back end code and connecting it to the front end, and deploying an application in Heroku.

## Core Objectives Met

1. When a user opens the Note Taker, they are presented with a landing page with a link to a notes page. 
2. When a user clicks on the link to the notes page, they are presented with a page with existing notes listed in the left-hand column, plus empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column
3. When a user enters a new note title and the note's text, then a Save icon appears in the navigation at the top of the page.
4. When a user clicks on the Save icon, the new note they have entered is saved and appears in the left-hand column with the other existing notes.
5. When a user clicks on an existing note in the list in the left-hand column, that note appears in the right-hand column.
6. When a user clicks on the Write icon in the navication at the top of the page, then they are presented with empty fields to enter a new note title and the note’s text in the right-hand column.
